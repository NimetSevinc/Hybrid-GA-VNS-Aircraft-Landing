**Airland Benchmark Instances**

This directory contains benchmark instances from the classical
OR-Library Aircraft Landing Problem (ALP) dataset.

The instances Airland 1 through Airland 12 are used in the experimental
analysis reported in this study. They are provided here to ensure full
reproducibility of the computational results.

Each instance file includes:
- the number of aircraft and freeze time,
- aircraft-specific time windows (earliest, target, latest),
- early and late landing penalty costs,
- required separation times between consecutive landings.
